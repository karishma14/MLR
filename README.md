# MLR
Multinomial Logistic Regression for Text Classification. 

Requirements
--------------
* python 
* liblinear-2.1 -- if you want to run SVM.py which performs L2-regularized, L2-loss Support Vector Classification

```
The output and images directory are created by the code present in the src directory. The ```images``` directory contains the plots for average cost over training epochs. The ```output\task1, output\task2, output\task3, output\task4``` directories contain the output generated by each task in the assignment.
Pipeline
----------
The input is expected in ```.json``` format located in the input directory. For this assignmnet the yelp reviews dataset is used.
* ``` data_reader.py```
    This file reads the data from raw format and performs the pre-processing.
* ```feature_generation.py```
    This file generates the various feature representations, including the baseline, feature hashing, normalization, tf-idf.
* ```MLR.py```
   The actual code for multinomial logistic regression is present here. 

All the intermediate data is stored in pickle format to the disk.
